# Hello-world
My first ever reposotory
Hi..
I am Raihan from Bangladesh. I am astudent. Currently I am studing at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology(BUET). I have one and a half years to go to complete my graduation on Electrical and Electronic Engineering. As an Engineeer I am very interested at developing things. From the first year of my graduation programm, I was doing some project work with my teammates. Some of the projects was very simple. But we aslo did some of interesting projects that no one of our university have done before. After every project we generally forget about that project and get busy with new things like exams, new projects etc. Sometimes we lose some files or instruments of our previous project. For this reason, I thought- Why not make a tutorial about this project and make it online so that I can get all the information about that project easily. I used google drive before to do this job. But after I got introduced with GitHub, I was totally amazed. Beacause it is the perfect platform that I wanted.
